  <h1>Case Studies</h1>

    These are two highlights from my coding studies in the last year. There is more information about my background in other disciplines on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisecostelloeward/">my LinkedIn profile.</a>

    <h2>Creative Dice</h2>
    <section class="creative-dice">
      <p>
        I write as a hobby and some of my friends are in writers groups.
        We have found creative dice useful as a writing prompt, but wanted to move away from relying on physical dice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I searched for creative dice online, the sites I found had dice diagrams that were printed out and then folded.
        </p>
          <p>
        This was not the remote version my friends and I needed. Some of us have dexterity issues with folding or do not have a printer.
      </p>

      <p>So I drew the pictures in Paint and built <a href="https://costelloeward.github.io/creative-dice/">online creative dice</a> myself.

    <h2>Frontend Mentor challenge</h2>
    <section class="frontend-mentor">
      <p>
        Frontend Mentor simulates being given a style guide and existing designs to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is useful for thinking about situations where assets or design decsions are already in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I picked <a href="https://costelloeward.github.io/profile-card-challenge/">this profile card exercise</a> as my first challenge so I could refersh my knowledge of positioning with modern CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt about the use cases for flex versus grid and experimented with negative margins in CSS.
