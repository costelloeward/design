  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <section class="bio">

    <p>
      I'm Louise, a service designer interested in coding and sustainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work for a non profit charity and am open to environmental projects, especially those with an emphasis on collaboration and systems thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working, you can find me running, drawing cartoon hedgehogs and <a href="https://poetryandmotion.medium.com/">writing the occasional poem.</a>

  <h2>About this website</h2>

  <section class="naming">
    <p>
      This site address comes from my last name. I seem to be the only person on the internet with my combination of first and last name, so I thought I'd make the most of it!
    </p>

  </section>
  <section class="environment">

    <p>
      I've been looking at how website performance and loading resources affect accessibility and sustainability.
      Heavier loads on performance can exclude people with lower data budgets and less reliable internet connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also use more electricity, which means they cost more.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="experiment">
    <p> As an experiment, I have built this site to be as lean as possible without images, frameworks or libraries.
      I have set the typeface to sans serif for readability. There are no custom typefaces or weights to download.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also no photos! Though you can find a picture of me by using the LinkedIn icon below.
