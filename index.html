  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <section class="bio">

    <p>
      I'm Louise, a service designer with an interest in front-end development. I like to work with users, all types of user insight, CSS, html and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me running, drawing cartoon hedgehogs and <a href="https://poetryandmotion.medium.com/">writing the occasional poem or tech blog.</a>
    </p>

    <section class="naming">
      <p>
        Costelloeward is based on my last name, which comes from two families.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Costelloes are creative, the Wards are practical. All my relatives ask questions about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use all these attributes in my work.
      </p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>
  <section class ="environment">

    <p>
      In the last year, I've been looking at how website performance and loading resources affect accessibility and sustainability.
Heavier loads on performance can exclude people with lower data budgets and less reliable internet connections.
    </p>
<p>
    They also use more electricity.
</p>
  </section>
<section class="experiment">
  <p>  As an experiment, I have built this site to be as lean as possible without images, frameworks or libraries.
    I have set the typeface to sans serif for readability. There are no custom typefaces or weights to download.
  </p>
  <p>
  I love bright colours, especially yellow and green. So I have used a gradient to represent my personality, rather than a photo of myself.
  </p>
</section>
  <!-- <section class="examples" to include when the my work page is bigger>
    <p>
      I can use additional resources when needed, and there are examples in <a href=https://costelloeward.github.io/design/mywork>the My Work area,</a> including Bootstrap and JQuery.
